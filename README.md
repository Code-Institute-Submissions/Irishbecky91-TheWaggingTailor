## Deployment

This project was developed using .

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. 

### Forking the Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/KryanLive "Link to GitHub Repo").
3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Creating a Clone
How to run this project locally:
1. Install the [GitPod Browser](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/ "Link to Gitpod Browser extension download") Extension for Chrome.
2. After installation, restart the browser.
3. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/KryanLive "Link to GitHub Repo").
5. Click the green "GitPod" button in the top right corner of the repository.
This will trigger a new gitPod workspace to be created from the code in github where you can work locally.

How to run this project within a local IDE, such as VSCode:

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](repo url "Link to GitHub Repo").
3. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
4. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
5. In your local IDE open the terminal.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
```
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
