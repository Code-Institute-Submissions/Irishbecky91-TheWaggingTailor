### **Development Planes**
To create a comprehensive and appealing website, the developer researched other pet-related websites to discover what features and functionality would be required. This information created the above user stories and is developed further below.

#### Main Inspirations
- [BarkBox](https://www.barkbox.com/ "Link to BarkBox")
- [Great Pet](https://home.greatpetcare.com/ "Link to Great Pet")
- [Chewy](https://www.chewy.com/ "Link to Great Pet")

#### **Strategy**
Broken into three categories, the website will attempt to focus on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - Site User
     - Site Owner

- **Demographic:**
     - Young to mature adults
     - Pet owners
     - Gift givers

- **Psychographics:**
    - Personality & Attitudes:
        - Fun-loving
        - Creative
        - Outgoing
        - Playful

    - Values:
        - Loves animals
        - Fashionable
        - Trendsetter

    - Lifestyles:
        - Has or knows someone who does have Pets
        - Keeps up with the latest trends

The website needs to enable the **Site User** to:

- Add their desired products to the shopping bag for purchasing.
- Filter products according to name, categories, rating and prices.
- Search products by name or description.
- Create a personalised profile relating to their pet type and measurements.

The website needs to enable the **Site Owner** to:
- Add, edit and delete products on the site.
- View orders on the admin screen

With the user stories in mind, the developer created the below strategy table to determine the trade-off of importance and viability with the following results:

![Strategy Table](static/media/README/strategy-table.png)

#### **Scope**
A scope was defined to identify what needed to be done to align features with the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:

- **Content Requirements**
    - The user will be looking for:
        - A variety of designs to choose from
        - Details of the products provided
        - A way to search the site using the name or description fields.
        - A filtering function by rating, name, price and category
        - A personalised Profile Page displaying the user's details and their pet's measurements
- **Functionality Requirements**
    - The user will be able to:
        - Select their desired size for each product, ie. Cat-M or Dog-XS
        - Update their profile with pet details and images
        - Easily navigate the site to find product information.

#### **Structure**
The information architecture was organized in a hierarchical tree structure to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:

![Site Map](static/media/README/site-map.png)

#### **Skeleton**

Wireframe mockups were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Link to Balsamiq's site"), providing a positive user experience with the following results:

</details>


#### **Database Structure**
In addition to wireframes, a Database ER Disgram was mocked up to show the relationship between the various database structures.

![Database ER Diagram](static/media/README/database-diagram.png)


### Design

#### **Colour Scheme**
The colour scheme was influenced by the home page photo. The yellow colour of the dog's sweater was chosen for the message bar to tie the photo in and make an attractive appearance. The navy coloured font, logo and nav background was influenced by the writing on the dog's ascot.

A clean white background was chosen for the top header to help give a pleasant, uncluttered appearance. The main background chosen was a white background with a very faint blue/grey pawprint pattern to give a subtle but playful design.

#### **Typography**
The font chosen for the headings and important text was Libre Baskerville for its simple, easy-to-read format. To complement this font, Open Sans was chosen for the standard text in text blocks and buttons, as well as the message bar.

#### **Imagery**
The imagery used in this site is entirely related to the products being sold, namely animals in clothing. A logo was also chosen to represent the company, showing an old-style sewing machine on top and a pawprint underneath.
