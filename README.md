### **Development Planes**
To create a comprehensive and appealing website, the developer researched other pet related websites to discover what features and functionality would be required. This information created the above user stories and is developed further below.

#### Main Inspirations
- [BarkBox](https://www.barkbox.com/ "Link to BarkBox")
- [Great Pet](https://home.greatpetcare.com/ "Link to Great Pet")
- [Chewy](https://www.chewy.com/ "Link to Great Pet")

#### **Strategy**
Broken into three categories, the website will attempt to focus on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - Site User
     - Site Owner

- **Demographic:**
     - Young to mature adults
     - Pet owners
     - Gift givers

- **Psychographics:**
    - Personality & Attitudes:
        - Fun loving
        - Creative
        - Outgoing
        - Playful

    - Values:
        - Loves animals
        - Fashionable
        - Trend setter

    - Lifestyles:
        - Has or knows someone who does have Pets
        - Keeps up with latest trends
        - Goes to pet shows
        - Likes to dress up


The website needs to enable the **Site User** to:
- Select that plan that suits the type of animal, as well as the toys/flavours they prefer.
- Purchase a subscription which renews each month unless instructed otherwise.
- View a selection of products not included in the subscription service.
- Create a personalised profile relating to their pet type and preferences

The website needs to enable the **Site Owner** to:
- Add, edit and delete products on the site.
- View orders in the admin screen

With the user stories in mind, the developer created the below strategy table to determine the trade-off of importance and viability with the following results:

        - Select their desired size for each product, ie. Cat-M or Dog-XS
        - Update their profile with pet details and images
        - Easily navigate the site to find product information.

#### Structure

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. 

### Forking the Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/KryanLive "Link to GitHub Repo").
3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
